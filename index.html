			One of my favorite CMSC Subject is CMSC 150 Numerical and Symbolic Computations because I love Math.

			My favorite Programming Language is Python because the syntax is very easy compared to other PLs.

			I love eating but one of my favorite food is Adobo, since I have my own style of cooking it and my mother loves it.
